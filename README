The original project is pyjenkinsci on googlecode: http://pyjenkinsci.googlecode.com/

A number of refactoring has been done:
 * uniform usage of jenkins instead of mixed jenkins/hudson
 * import fixup, all imports are relative to packagename now
 * downloading artifacts is simplified

New features:
 * username/password auth support for jenkins instances with auth turned on
 * Ability to add/remove/query jenkins slaves
 * Ability to retrieve/find builds by subversion revision

Deletion:

I've completely removed the test methods and the small amount of test cases
All tests were tied to a specific local environment.

Thanx to salimfadhley@gmail.com for the initial version which we based this on
Thanx to ruslan@hyves.nl for the subversion revision patches

Current code lives on github: https://github.com/ramonvanalteren/jenkinsapi.git
